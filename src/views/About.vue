            <h2>关于这个网站</h2>
            <p>RateMyProfessors.com is built for college students, by college students. Choosing the best courses and professors is a rite of passage for every student, and connecting with peers on the site has become a key way for millions of students to navigate this process. The site does what students have been doing forever - checking in with each other – their friends, their brothers, their sisters, their classmates – to figure out who's a great professor and who's one you might want to avoid.</p>
